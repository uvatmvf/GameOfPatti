This project follows industry standards of Agile Test Driven Development.

## Game of Patti
'Game of Patti' is a scrolling first person video game in the same lineage as Rainbow 6, Counterstrike, FortNite, meets Mario Kart. 
It is team based and with similar capture the flag type match play to win variations. 

# Reguirements
## Teams
The teams are 'Pandus' and 'Kurus'. 

## Terrain
The basic military unit of the 18 day war described in the Hindu Epic, Mahabharata. 'One chariot, three horses, one elephant, five soldiers make up a Patti.'
The flow of the game as a scroller follows the bi-directional flow of the elephants and chariots moving in streams. Players can jump onto the chariots from the ground, and onto elephants' backs from the chariots. The effect of elephants in a line should be like jumping on moving train cars in a western shooter. The goal of combat on the back of an elephant is to knock the other player back onto the ground. Jumping  onto chariots from the ground should be like GTA car jacking. 

The game elements should scale with the number of players. More players, more elephants and chariots.

## Player Mechanics
Standard first person shooter fair. A range of weapons, including crude fists, the user can toggle.
Players use range and melee weapons (bows and arrows, lances, clubs and swords.) 

## Player vs. Player Combat
As a first person shooter, players have an array of weapon choices.
Choice of weapon is restricted by terrain, and mode of combat.

Bows and arrows are used only from within chariots. With the exception of special weapons, arrows are not unlimited. Arrows should regenerate like mana. Replenishment should be a point of gameplay for replenishment.

Lances are used only from atop an elephant to attack grounded combatants; whom can defend themselves by successfully grabbing the lance and pulling the attacker off the elephant.
A chariot that is struck by a lance should throw the wielder with damage.
Player combat on the ground using swords maces and fists.
Players can be damaged by NPCs, such as getting thrown and trampled under an elephant.

## NPC combatants
NPC kshatriyas AI, if included, should be as effective as first generation storm troopers.

## NPCs as non-combatants
Elephants and Chariot drivers are non-combatant NPC driven by AI. They are more like moving terrain than player territory. The players may fight from chariots or elephant back, but do not steer them are not able to meaningfully damage or kill the horses or chariot drivers to disrupt game play.

# Product Backlog
## User Story Backlog
- As a kshatriya, I want to fire a bow and arrow from a chariot, so that I can duel with bow fighters coming at me from other chariots. 
- As a kshatriya, I want to lance ground combatants from the back of an elephant, so that I can snipe other players. 
- As a kshatriya, I want to fight with maces, swords and fists on the ground, so that I can rock players that get knocked off elephants or chariots. 
- As a kshatriya, I want to avoid damaging elephants, so that I do not get immediately gored or trampled.

## Feature Backlog
### Kshatriya Player Characters
Players can play regular warrior characters. Kshatriyas do not have any special abilities at the start of a round, but can acquire in game weapons or abilities by defeating heroes in combat.
### Hero Player Characters 
Each team is led by 3-4 heroes, each with a special weapon ability. 

Pandus - Arjuna (unlimited arrows), Bhima (instant kill with bare hands and deadly mace combat), Abhimanyu (fast rate of fire), Sahadeva (deadly sword combat)
Kurus - Duryodhana (deadly mace combat), Drona (unlimited arrows), Karna (special arrow rocks chariots, throwing players to ground) Ashwatthama (celestial arrow).
### Hero Non-Player Character

Krishna's chariot - Outfitted with four horses, two more than the standard game chariot, Krishna's chariot is Arjuna's starting point in the game and can be steered by a human player. Only available to the Pandus.


Ashvwatthama the elephant - A larger than life war elephant that loves to flip over the Pandu's chariots with his huge tusks. Ashvwatthama the elephant starts each match with the Kurus, but can be commandeered by any human player if the kurus can be dislodged from the elephant's back by the Pandus.  

# Fine Print Mission Statement
'Game of Patti' is a lightweight development framework modeled on Agile software development for experience seeking applicants. The point of the game is to provide an unending stream of implementation work for motivated candidates to pursue. The work shall be placed in a public GitHub, that the developer seeking experience can reference as an online portfolio.As the product owner, I intend to provide only the development platform, I have no bandwidth to participate as a developer.
